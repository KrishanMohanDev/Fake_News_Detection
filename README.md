# Fake News Detection Project

This project aims to classify news articles as either fake or real using machine learning techniques. Below are the necessary steps to run this project:

## Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/KrishanMohanDev/Fake_News_Detection.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:
   ```
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```
   
3. **Run the Code:**
   Open the cloned repository in your preferred Python environment and run the code in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python editor.

4. **Data Preparation:**
   Ensure the datasets `Fake.csv` and `True.csv` are placed in the `Dataset` directory within the project folder.

5. **Execute the Code:**
   Execute the code cells provided in the Jupyter Notebook or Python script. This will preprocess the data, train different machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

6. **Manual Testing:**
   After training the models, you can manually test the news classification using the `manual_testing` function. Enter a news article when prompted, and the models will predict whether it's fake or real.

7. **Interpret Results:**
   Interpret the results obtained from the classification models to determine their effectiveness in detecting fake news.

8. **Experimentation:**
   Feel free to experiment with different machine learning models, hyperparameters, and feature engineering techniques to improve the performance of the fake news detection system.

9. **Contribute:**
   Contributions to this project, such as adding new features or improving existing algorithms, are welcome. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

10. **Enjoy!**
   Explore the code, learn about fake news detection techniques, and enjoy experimenting with the project!
